**== FEATURED QUESTION ==**
**Why can't I use Windows?**

> a. We're not paid to support anything here, this is all free
>
> b. We don't use windows as developers
>
> c. Most developers use a Unix type system in this field
>
> d. Almost all servers are Linux based 
>
> e. Most directions would need to be re-written to accommodate, and we link to external resources often. 
>
> f. We've tried and people have more issues than with Linux
>
> g. Linux isn't that difficult to learn if you are most people with a standard system
>
> h. Ruby and Rails has issues with Windows, and people switching tracks would find themselves in deep trouble trying to go down that rabbit hole
>
> i. git, and other tools, were written for Linux first, using them on Windows is sub-par, especially for beginners trying to navigate the technical world
>
> j. WSL2 just isn't quite there, there's issues with tooling and paths
>
> k. We support windows users with VBox, as it's the closest thing we can get to letting people use windows, and most people don't have trouble with it
>
> l. Translating directions to Mac is a lot easier than Windows because Mac is a Unix based system.
>
> m. Setting up Linux is FAR easier than learning to program. Having beginners attempt to navigate the differences with Windows is more difficult than teaching them a bit of Linux
>
> n. Learning things like Linux helps people be more flexible in their environments. It's often that you will not get to use Windows in your job
>
> o. Employers often expect a person to know Unix based environments so this is part of becoming a developer
>
> p. Suggesting the teachers support a book they did not choose is a bit in bad taste, and it becomes too difficult when too many people want support for too many platforms, therefore we've had to limit it
>
> q. People have a hard time understanding when you need to use Windows paths vs Unix paths when using different tech unless experienced.
>
> r. Those that get advanced enough with Linux (and that advanced bar, is real low in this case), will be able to choose Windows later and understand the tech that other resources are talking about
>
> s. Our time is better spent writing more content instead of trying to shoehorn something that doesn't belong into a course. Especially when it comes to external resources that do not have Windows directions.
>
> t. There are other courses that will happily let you use Windows. We're not trying to compete with them and we don't need to. We instead find the best resources on the internet and bring them together. They just so happen to all be Linux based.

**What is TOP**

TOP is the abbreviation of The Odin Project

**What is club-40**

Those who have achieved 40 points in the server by helping others and receiving '++'s

**What are the Maintainers/Core roles?**

Staff of TOP

**Can TOP help get me a job?**

We do not offer job services, however, completing TOP means you have the skills and qualifications to find a job, see #getting-hired and the getting hired section of the curriculum. #odin-success-stories are also a good source of motivation.

**Does TOP give certificates?**

No, certificates do not have much value outside of very small niches in IT, usually not programming. After TOP, your portfolio should speak for itself

**Can I post my affiliate links, self promote, advertise my server/product here?**

Almost always no. Do not assume you have permission. We may entertain things that are not designed to make money or take away from the mission of TOP.

**How long does TOP take?**

There is no data on this information, between 3 months and 3 years seems to be the range. Read this for more info: 

> For anybody worried about "how long it takes", consider these things:
>
> It may take you longer than others to grasp concepts, or it may take you less time. This doesn't mean you're smarter or dumber than others, it means you've had differing life experiences that may or may not have prepared you for learning this stuff. Someone who grew up around an engineer may have some advantages over someone who didn't, but it doesn't mean you can't learn those skills.
>
> The Odin Project isn't like college or university, TOP is self paced and allows you to get a really solid grasp of concepts before moving on. In school, you're forced to keep up or you will fail. The difference here is that coming into TOP, you're not expected to have much knowledge, there's no prerequisites. We've had people be successful coming through here that only knew how to check their email with a computer, we've also seen success from computer science degree holders. Treating TOP like a static timeline is ignorant simply because you don't know what you don't know yet, and that's OK! There's no due-dates on things in The Odin Project so you can spend the time to do it right and discuss the topics.

**Can I contribute?**

Of course, check out our github and follow the contributing guide: https://github.com/TheOdinProject

**What is Thinkful and their relationship to TOP?**
Thinkful pays the bills around here, it was part of the deal when Erik sold Viking Code School to Thinkful. They don't ask us for anything in return except a small ad on the site. They do not use our curriculum, nor do they contribute to ours. TOP is fully run by the Core and Maintainer teams, as well as other contributors on a volunteer basis. 

**Are you affiliated with "\_\_\_\_\_ bootcamp"?**

Very most likely not, see this: 

> Microverse is using our content without permission
> 
> they are making money from our stuff without permission
> 
> We've asked them to stop as well. They will not
> 
> Microverse has no permission from us to use our hard work for their ill gained funds. They're expensive as well, especially for a program that uses students to teach the next ones.
> It's scummy, and anti-consumer

**Does TOP teach Python or XYZ language?**

Go to https://www.theodinproject.com and look around, I'm sure you can find answers there quickly. Also read this: 

> My point is: 
> 
> The language (or framework) doesn't matter, learning how to understand a problem and work through it. There's concepts like inheritance composition, higher order functions, OOP, FP, abstraction, module pattern, pub/sub, parallel code,  and more that you can't learn just from writing code. This stuff is some really big conceptual stuff in CS. To learn those, you need a good teacher or course. 
> 
> When to apply a pattern or algorithm to a problem isn't something a language itself can teach you.
> 
> also, read this: https://medium.com/@bycdiaz/choosing-the-right-language-a-short-guide-on-how-not-to-ruin-your-career-2b353be1371

**Which path should I take? / What language should I learn?**

It doesn't matter, though there's more information at the end of Foundations. Don't worry until you have completed Foundations. More info here:

**TOP doesn't offer xyz language, what should I do?**

Read the above answer's link. It covers this.

**In what order should I take the courses of the curriculum?**

You should start at the beginning and not skip, even if you feel you are experienced. Part of what makes TOP work is building on previous knowledge in the curriculum. If you know the stuff, it will go quickly, if you do not, you'll be glad you did it. TOP expects you to have gone through the previous sections before each next section. This is a curriculum, not a collection of tutorials.

**Should I take notes?**

Mostly, no. Understanding > memorization. 

**Do I need a degree to get a job?**

Generally no, however a degree can help you get past some non-understanding HR people. Many people have become successful without them, see #odin-success-stories.

**Should I do multiple courses at the same time?**
No, 

> 1. Beginner content is most of the content you'll find for learning resources, going over the same topics multiple times isn't going to help you. What helps is practice and pushing forward. Often times concepts don't really make sense till later due to the nature of this stuff. If you use multiple courses at the same time, you'll just be spending more time iterating over those basic parts without understanding how they get used together. This just adds time to your learning. Once you finally move on in the other course, you may have lost a lot of the context that it had and you'll be stuck and have to do it over again, thus slowing you down more and more. When you've learned something, you need to solidify it with practice, not just doing the topics again. 
> 
> 2. Different courses have different methods of delivering material, mixing these can cause confusion and mix you up by not focusing on one topic and spreading your attention across multiple topics. This means that instead of getting one topic understood well,  you either take twice as long (or more, considering point 1) learning them at the same time before you can implement them or you don't understand either topic deeply enough to help you later down the line. Focusing on *one* topic at a time lets you become more proficient in that topic faster because you have one point of focus.
> 
> 3. Doing two courses also means you have to spend time deciding which one to work on at any given moment instead of pushing through content, this sets you back a lot due to analysis paralysis. 
> 
> 4. Overwhelming amounts of content. TOP takes about a year in most cases to make a good developer. Imagine trying to do multiple TOPs and consider the previous points in this consideration.
>
> 5. Tutorial hell: It's very easy to bounce between resources and just do the beginner stuff over and over and over making it feel like you're solidifying concepts (this is related to point 1), not committing to one course is going to make it a lot easier to bounce between different beginner courses looking for the "best" one. However, there is no "best", when you're a self-learner, it's about learning yourself and not being handed the concepts.
>
> 6. Communities: Often times it's hard to find help for topics on courses that do not have a good community and it can be rude to bring that baggage to another community.
>
> 7. If your courses use different languages, you can easily confuse the two and struggle to write decent code in either. Concepts transfer, but only after you're a programmer, not still struggling with basic stuff.
>
> Oone of the biggest mistakes you can do as a learner is try to follow multiple courses at the same time.

**Is there an Odin dark theme?**
Yup! 

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-odin-project-dark-the/omiecnmmajomefpodcdjkebeonieonef?hl=en-US

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/the-odin-project-dark-theme/

**Is TOP hard?**
Very, but that doesn't mean you can't do it. Learning programming in general is tough, no matter where you go. Grit is something you will need to develop to get through it, read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)

**Does the TOP staff get paid?**
Nope, this is run by the community, for the community without pay of any sort.

**Can I promote here?**
Very likely not, people trying to make money on The Odin Project is not part of our mission. Self promotion permission is granted on an individual basis. If you don't have permission, don't promote. This does not apply to sharing things you've built in the showcase for the purpose of sharing. Promotion for products or services there will be deleted.

**What is a "help vampire" or "vamp"?**
http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/ <-- This is actually a really good read about one of the biggest problems that exists in online communities

**How can I help others solve their coding problems?**
Read the following tips:
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/join-the-odin-community#how-to-help-others-solve-coding-problems

**How should I ask questions?**

> Hey folks! I just wanted to make a quick post about how to best get help here, aside from our /question article! This is in general, not directed towards anyone specific. UPDATE: This is now a lesson on our website! https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/asking-for-help
> 
> 1. Your code should ALWAYS be provided. You can ask theoretical, vague questions, but you’re going to get theoretical, vague answers that probably won't be helpful. Provide as much context as possible, and zero in on the specific problem so people can give you the most relevant answers.
> 
> 2. On the topic of giving context, ASK ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM, NOT THE SOLUTION. A lot of folks ask “How do I do this instruction from the project specifications”? Well, don’t forget you’re actually supposed to figure that out for yourself. A much better question is, “Hey, I’m trying to do this instruction from this project, but I’m getting this error, how can I fix this? Here’s my code.” 
> 
> If I’m assigned a bug fix at work, and I literally ask “how do I fix this bug?”, well, what are they paying me for? But asking where I can start, what I’ve tried, and what I can research to help figure it out pays dividends. It also helps me learn what I obviously don't know yet. 

3. Don’t take asking for more context to heart! We are here to help! We want to help you. But a question you may feel is totally coherent, probably isn’t if we’re asking for more context. We don’t link you to /question to be jerks! People here are volunteers, none of us are paid to run the chat, and folks don’t have to answer your question. But if they truly do want to answer you, they will ask for more information
**What books should I read/do you recommend?**
Our curriculum will recommend books when the time is right. If you haven't come across recommendations, the time isn't right. Yet. (Though, I've heard Moby Dick is a good book)

**How can I get the "professional" and "alumni" role?**
The "professional" role is limited to those who are verified industry professionals such as software engineers, software developers, web developers, and other associated software development team roles. The "alumni" role is limited to professionals who also went through the TOP curriculum and gained their employment due to TOP. Please DM @tati todoroki :snowflake::fire: with your LinkedIn to be granted this role.
