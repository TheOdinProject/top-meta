# Maintainers

## Purpose of Maintainer Role

Maintainers are representatives of The Odin Project community who assist with moderating the official Discord server and the management of processes on the Github account.

### Admission and Removal of Role

Maintainers, and those wishing to be considered for the Maintainer role, are expected to have a record of regular and positive contributions to The Odin Project community. Maintainers are expected to make contributions to The Odin Project curriculum and provide support for the Discord server.

Being that contributions will vary in substance and frequency, the Core team will determine if the member is meeting the expectations for the Maintainer role. If the expectations are not being met, the member will not be considered for the Maintainer role. If member is currently a Maintainer, they will be moved to Maintainer-Emeritus role with the option to return to Maintainer status upon making regular contributions.

## Github Responsibilities and Guidelines

### Maintain Issues

- A maintainer should spend time maintaining the Github
- As a maintainer, you should use your discretion on which issues *you* should take yourself. Part of your goal, is to increase contributions from the entire community
- **Delete/Close** irrelevant and unhelpful issues and comments
    - **Explain reasoning for closing issue**
    - Before deletion, ask for more info if issue could be viable 
    - People asking for help on projects, should be directed to the forum or chat before deletion
- **Add tags to issues as applicable** (Check the right side of the page on an open issue)
    - e.g. "First Time Only" (for super easy issues, to help gain more contributors)
- **Modify issue contents with more information that could be relevant**
    - Adding a checklist for definition of "success" for whoever takes the issue
    - Suggestions on possible solutions
- **Ask for contributions in the #contributions-opportunities channel**
    - Do not go overboard, people don't like getting pinged a lot
    - Consider batching requests in one ping
- **Assign issues to those claiming it** (Check the right side of the page on an open issue)
    - People should comment on the issue they are working on the issue
- **Moving issues to the proper section on the project board** (Check the right side of the page on an open issue)
    - Curriculum issues should be attached to the 'curriculum' project board
    - Most things will be "backlog" unless it breaks significant parts of the course
        - e.g. Hartl puts his books behind a paywall
    - When assigned to somebody, issue should be put in "in-progress"
        - Don't be afraid to check up on people working on issues
    - Issues with attached PRs will be closed automatically
- **Keep an eye on the project board**
    - Feel free to follow up with people, but give them ample time

### Maintain PRs (Pull Requests)

- **Close PRs** that are irrelevant, or clearly unhelpful to the project
    - e.g. Somebody PRs solutions to any lesson that is to be cloned and filled out
        - https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises
    - Be sure to give a reason for closing the PR
- **Attach issues** to the PR that should be closed when the PR is merged (Check the right side of the page on an open PR)
- **Review thoroughly**
    - Look very closely at the markdown
    - Utilize the request changes feature when reviewing code/lesson content
        - Feel free to fix small typos and wording using the in-browser editor
        -  https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews
    - New lessons will have to have the "seeds" file updated to accomodate and show on the site
- **Updates** to the markdown will be reflected on the site **once a day**
    - If somebody asks why their PR isn't showing, this is why
- **Merge PRs**
    - Since you are a maintainer, we trust your judgement. With git, everything can be reverted, so don't be afraid to merge things from non-maintainers/core.
        - Ask Kevin about his screw-ups (and Marvin)
    - If a PR looks to be good, feel free to merge after review
    - Do not merge if you are unsure, ask somebody else for review
