### Moderation code of Ethics
This document will go over the general ethical code that moderators are expected to uphold as part of being part of the public face for the odin project.
This is not an exhaustive list and will evolve over time, however this will serve as a baseline for expectations regarding moderation conduct.


## General ethical guidelines
- As moderators you should be an advocate for users. Even those being actioned. Your the face of fairness and power and need to remember this when approaching moderation actions.
- Interactions are to inform the user of the specific behavior that goes against the rules and is **not** intended to reform a community member. 
- Moderation enforcements should be swift, most if not all individuals on the server are learners themselves and we don't want to take away time or leave them with a bad impression by extending moderation actions any longer than necessary.
- Ensure that your providing as much information upfront as possible to allow for transparent communication between a moderator and community member. This includes their Zap count, The specific matrix rule broken, and the context of why this is moderation action is occuring and any other relevant information. This avoids confusion for the community member and helps to avoid an escalation resulting from not having **all information shared**.
- The goal of moderation is **not** to ban individuals and should not be the goal of moderation actions barring extreme situations such as harrassment, racism, directly threatening community members, etc. 
- Engage with community members in a good faith manner and trust that they will ask questions if the context of a moderation interaction is unclear. Do not try and lead them to a certain response or get them to respond a certain way as this can escalate a situation. It's important we trust and respect our community members to ask questions if something is unclear during a moderation action.
- Do not leave threads unresolved. This places the burden on other members and barring extreme circumstances it is important to see them through so community members don't see you as unreliable or unprofessional. Remember you are a part of the public face for the odin project and they will judge us as a team and yourself in a interaction and leaving early can give them a negative experience and view of both the team and yourself.
- Do not overextend yourself. If your feeling burn out please take time to inform other members of the team and take a step back. We want you to have a good experience modding and be in top shape during these interactions so don't forget to take a vacation once in a while!

## P.E.G. (Patience, Empathetic, Grace)
- Have patience. Be aware that some community members **may have never interacted with a moderated discord** and as such they may have a bunch of questions or may not understand. Answer the questions to the best of your ability and invite them to look over the rules and matrix so you can step away if need be.
- Be empathetic during interactions. This means considering situational context and don't assume that users are engaging in malicious behavior without considering the situational context. Bans should also not be the first approach nor should they be the approach if there is any other possible alternative action.
- Have grace for individuals. This does **not** mean excusing rule-breaking behavior but it does mean to be receptive to individuals questions regarding rules, the matrix and how they can change their behavior. Ensure the user is aware they can ask questions at the end of mod actions. 

## Deescalation
- If a user has become upset, is frustrated or seems perturbed about the moderation action the goal should be to deescalate the conversation. Do **not** try and continue to explain what they did wrong. Moderators have a responsibility to be an advocate for the users and this means leaving a final warning and defusing the situation rather than continuing the interaction. 
- Moderators should base Zaps on the overall situation **not look for additional minor technalities to zap individuals**. It is important we be empathetic and consider the behavior as a whole rather than make the community member feel they are being watched.
- Moderators should avoid statements that could be as interpreted as accusoratory towards the user of engaging in wrongful behavior without explaining the context and how the behavior goes against the matrix. This includes turning moderation actions into discussions and moving away from a actual moderation action.

## Confidentiality 
- Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public. While we expect members to honor the confidentiality of this space, we cannot guarantee that they will do so--nor can we guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

## Feedback 
- It's important to remember that moderation is a team effort and gracefully accepting constructive criticism is critical.
- Before acting on negative emotions, give the other user the benefit of the doubt and calmly ask them for clarification on parts of their messages that upset you without being accusatory. If you feel that your negative emotions are influencing your responses **step away and be frank that your negative emotions are impacting your ability to be neutral**.
