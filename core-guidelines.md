# What is Core

Core members are maintainers first and foremost, with the added responsibility to manage the platform as a whole, for the betterment of the platform. 

This can mean
* final decisions on large topics via votes
* handling the final decisions related to infrastructure (but not necessarily managing it, that can be anybody on the team)
* handling any licensure items
* being "legal owners" of assets and brand
* owning any sensitive material (such as keys, passwords, payment information, etc)
* manage any benefactor relationships
* and any other necessary executive decisions

# Social Contract

This social contract is created, altered, and maintained by the team and should be reviewed regularly. It’s our by-laws. People need to be held accountable to these and anyone joining needs to accept the contract and understand that they will be called out for not following it. 

Following social contract should be one of the considerations of “performance grading” for Core / Maintainer. 

- Remember there is a real human being on the other side of the screen. 
- Assume positive intent.
- Be honest, transparent, and respectful.
- Be fair, be kind, and be gracious.
- Keep the mission of The Odin Project above your personal ambitions. 
- Consider your peers as the professionals they are. Your experience does not trump others. 
- Embrace the unique differences on the team and learn from each other to be a better Core/Maintainer member, and even beyond TOP. 
- Be aware of difficulties of typed communication where tone and voice are hard to interpret. Keep use of sarcasm, emojis, slang to a minimum during more serious discussions. 
- Healthy conflict where others opinions are heard is welcome, but we should avoid it turning into personal fighting, insulting or sarcasm.
- Stay true to your promises. Communicate clearly when you can’t keep up or deliver what is promised. No shame in that. 
- Avoid focusing on an individual. Focus on a problem and how it can be solved as a team.
- Don’t continuously complain about issues without proposing a solution. 
- Communicate prolonged absences as defined per role expectations.
- Opinions change, people should respect that but also be ready to defend yourself when pressed on the topic, but it must all be done respectfully.
- People have a right to their opinions, if the explanation of their opinion is not to your liking, you must still respect that outcome. Defer to voting if necessary

# Procedure for reporting concerns about Odin Leadership.

Leadership in this case encompasses Core, Maintainer or Moderators.  Concerns can include, but should not be limited to infractions against the Social Contract, expectations listed here, and Discord rule infractions.

- Regardless of where a report originates, all reports concerning a staff member (Core, Maintainer or Moderator) should ultimately be handled by the Core team.
- Because of the likelihood that the offending person is likely to be able to see a report against them, reports against Odin leadership should begin in a **Direct Message to at least 2 non-offending Core members**.
- Should a user not feel comfortable approaching a Core member, it is appropriate and acceptable for them to Direct Message any other staff member (Maintainer or Moderator) who will then escalate the complaint in a Direct Message to 2 non-offending Core members, as outlined above.
- Those Core members will bring the concern to the rest of the core team, minus the person in question and the issue will be dealt with.
- The Core team, minus the person in question, may create a group DM thread with the reporter to ask clarifying questions or request evidence of the reported infraction
- If a report has not been responded to in a timely manner (within 24 hours), it is acceptable and appropriate to either ask for a follow-up, or take the report to another staff member.
- The reporter of the infraction should not expect to recieve details of any action the Core team decides to take, but is entitled to some confirmation that the report has been recieved and appropriately escalated.

# Core Expectations

## Remain active 

Stay up-to-date with changes that affect any one, but not necessarily all, of the various topics that comprise The Odin Project
- TOP-meta contribution and tracking
- Repositories under the TOP umbrella
- Infrastructure that runs TOP
- Relationships with benefactors/stakeholders (e.g. Thinkful)
- Core and maintainer channels on the server
- Major curriculum changes
- Votes
- Meetings
- Initiatives (Fireside chat, TOPathons, gamejams)

## Maintenance of the platform
- Curriculum contributions, edits, changes, PR review, and helping drive contributors all fall under this umbrella
- Core members should follow the maintainer guidelines for contributions, with relaxed requirements to spend time on initiatives
- Some core members may have specializations that bend this guideline at times, though, contributing to top-meta is still a requirement
- Maintenance can mean community events (TOPathons, game-jams, Fireside chats), design/UX, and other items like social media

## Communication    
- Communicate absences. For different reasons, related to work, studies, family, etc. there will be periods of time where a Core member can not commit to the demands of TOP and its community, either as much as one would like or as much as is needed. However, this should be the exception, not the rule.
- Propose changes to function or form of The Odin Project
  - Curriculum Changes
  - Moderation strategy
  - Site functionality
  - Initiatives (e.g. Gamejams, TOPathons, Fireside chats)
  - Etc.
- Communications should happen on a semi-regular cadence

## Make informed decisions
- Everybody is expected to vote
- Some things may not have any guidelines
- Use the voting system in place

## Adhere to the social contract

## Be a leader
- Continue to do everything in your ability within reason to improve and maintain the quality of the platform for the end-user with respect to the time and efforts of those maintaining the platform.

## Large 
Simple majority vote, 24 hours

Examples:

* Non reversible or difficult to reverse changes to the chat (deleting rooms)
* Significant reworks of the chat rules system (i.e. the proposed ‘zaps’ matrix system)
* Adding Chat-mods and/or Maintainers
* Major site feature overhauls

## Massive
Super majority vote (9 approvals if 12 core), ALL memmbers must vote

Examples:
* Adding or Removing Core members
* Removing maintainers or chat-mods
* Decisions about the future of Odin

## Etc.
Anything that is small to medium that is brought up during a monthly meeting can be decided upon. Anything large, must have an agenda item to have been decided in a meeting.

In general, disagreement at a lower level would escalate an item to the next level. So, if something is considered a small impact no-vote item, but concerns about it are brought up in chat.. Simply escalate it to medium and call a vote.

A core Member’s judgement should be used and considered when selecting a level. if a proposer calls something medium-impact, but someone else suggests that they would feel more comfortable escalating it.we should default to escalating.
